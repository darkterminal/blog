My name is Emil Marklund and I am currently studying computing science and engineering at Ume√• University, Sweden.

I love to learn new stuff and I also like to help others. That is the main reason for my blog: by writing about what I learn I can help others learn.

I wrote my first program in Basic when I was about 10 years old. I've been programming to some extent ever since, mostly hobby projects. I've tried quite a few programming languages but I'm most proficient in C, Python or Java.

I'm an [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user and an advocate for open source. I agree with [the fsf](http://www.fsf.org/) in spirit, but I favor permissive free software licensing (such as [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) over copyleft licenses such as [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

I am a GNU Linux user and have tried numerous distributions, but have most experience from Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.
