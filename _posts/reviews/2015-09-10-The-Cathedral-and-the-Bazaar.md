I have been interested in the open source community for a very long time, so
I've known about the book for a very long time. This summer I bought myself an
[e-reader][e-reader] and I finally found the time to read The Cathedral and the
Bazaar (CatB).

# About the book

The book is freely available [in various digital formats][catb-archive]. The
language in the book is sometimes quite technical, but for someone with minor
programming experience and some Unix/Linux-knowledge the book should be quite
easy to read.

The main topic in the book is community-driven software development. In the
book, the development of Linus Torvalds' Linux kernel is used as an example of
community-driven software development, while other projects (such as Emacs) were
used as an example of projects that were open source, but the development were
still restricted to the persons on the mailing lists.

Eric describes the two development styles as *the Bazaar style*: anarchic
development where anyone can grab an interesting problem and propose a
solution. 

*The Cathedral style* of development is closed for the common people. Problems
are assigned to developers in a hierarchical manner. While the end users may
have access to the source code, they are not invited to contribute to
development. Cathedral style development is common among businesses working on a
product.

In the book, Erik describes how he observed Linus's methods and used the same
tricks when Eric took over the development of [fetchmail][fetchmail].

## Reflections

As I started this point: I've known about the book for a very long time. I've
also been interested and somewhat involved in various open source project for a
long time. The book didn't bring any ground breaking revelations for me, but it
gave me another perspective on open source development.

The book is written in the 90's. I get the feeling that bazaar-style has become
synonyme with open source today, but this probably wasn't the case when the book
was written. I think this somewhat historic perspective provides a valuable
insight.

I also found Eric's experiences while trying the bazaar rationale while
developing fetchmail to be quite interesting, how he tried the methods he had
learned from observing Torvalds.

# Why do people contribute to open source?

Something I found especially interesting in the book is the philosophy behind
why people want to contribute to open source. This is something I use to think
about a lot.

The book doesn't discuss this as much in-depth that I would like, but the book
still brings some interesting aspects.

Personally, I like tackling difficult problems. I like to use my mind, and I
like to feel intelligent. I believe that this is the main reason why I like to
contribute. Contributing to open source is a way to show that you are
intelligent, *while not necessarily bragging*.

Sure, there are lots of altruistic reasons for contributing to open source. But
deep down, I believe lots of people (myself included) have a lot of egoistic
motivation behind the altruistic contributions.

## Conclusion

I would not recommend the book for grandma or anyone else
non-technical. However, I would say that The Cathedral and the Bazaar can be
viewed as *general knowledge* among ambitious programmers and people within the
open source community, and should at least be on the to-read list of anyone
within these two categories. 

For me personally, the book did not any new valuable information, but for
someone who has no experience of open source the book may be an important eye
opener. In fact, I often recommend people doubting open source to read the book,
and I will continue to do so even now that I myself has read it. ;)

I would give the book 6.5 merge requests of 10 possible.
